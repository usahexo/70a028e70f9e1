#  Are there any risks associated with using a random team generator wheel?

When you're looking to fill out a team for your next fantasy football league or just want to put together a cobbled-together squad of randos for a weekend soccer game, using a random team generator wheel can be a tempting solution. But are there any risks associated with using one of these tools?

The short answer is: yes, there are risks. But they're mostly mitigated if you use a reputable random team generator wheel and pay attention to the potential dangers.

First and foremost, there's always the risk of picking players who are injured or simply not playing well. If you're choosing your team blindly, you might not know that the players you've selected are dealing with injuries or poor form. This could lead to disaster on game day.

Another risk is that of skewed selections. If the random team generator wheel you're using isn't completely random, it's possible for certain players to be over- or under-represented in your team. This can lead to an imbalanced and ineffective squad.

Finally, there's always the risk that the generator wheel itself is faulty. If you're using a low-quality tool, it's possible for it to produce inaccurate results - resulting in an unworkable team. So make sure you do your research before selecting a random team generator wheel!
