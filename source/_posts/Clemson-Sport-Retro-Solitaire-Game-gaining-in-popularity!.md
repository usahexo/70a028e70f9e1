#  Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game gaining in popularity!

Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire, also known as C.S.R.S., is a card game that is becoming increasingly popular on college campuses across the United States. The game is said to have originated at Clemson University, and thus the name.

The object of the game is to score points by arranging cards into melds and runs. A meld is three or more cards of the same rank, such as three queens or two aces and a king. A run is three or more cards in sequence, such as ace, two, three, four, five. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

To begin the game, the player must first deal six cards face-up in a row on the table, setting aside the remaining cards for later use. These six cards become the player's hand. The player then selects one card from their hand and sets it face-down in front of them. This card becomes the open card and starts the discard pile. The player may then draw one card from either the deck or the discard pile to add to their hand.

If the player can form a meld with any of the six cards in their hand, they must do so and set the meld's stack face-down in front of them. If they cannot form any melds, they must discard one card from their hand to start the next turn's discard pile. Play then passes to the next player who must draw one card from either deck or discard pile and can either set down another meld or discard another card as normal until they are able to put down another melded stack or there are no more cards left to draw from either pile ending their turn..
Other players are not allowed touch other players' face down cards nor see other player's face down cards until these are turned over at end of current players turn if any point . 


When all but one player has no more cards left in their individual hands (and only those holding still have validly formed stacks), these remaining players reveal their stacks: if any reveal previously unplayed wildcards (these replace whatever was underneath), then these particular wildcards are now considered as played for that particular game (although not as part of any stacks), with play continuing thereafter albeit differently;players now score points for any runs/melds revealed in same way-unless someone already has an ace awaiting fourth wildcard spot which would beat anyone else;or that particular Ace shows up again whereupon holder immediately replaces current Ace with appropriate fresh new 4th Wildcard (face up on table) before contniuing play all over again getting rid of any other 3rd Wildcard should it come out-again by forming RUN with 2nd Wildcard being part 
Ending conditions depend on how many people are playing -see below-.

 Winner(s) are whoever has most combined score(points) when somebody either cannot put down anymore valid tiles/cards at all OR all remaining tiles rturned over--show everyone regardless who actually won .

#  Who will win the Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game?

The Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game is a highly anticipated event. This year, there are two clear favorites — Clemson and Alabama.

Clemson has had a strong season so far, while Alabama has been struggling. However, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa back in action, the Tide are likely to make a comeback.

Tagovailoa is a Heisman Trophy candidate and is sure to give Clemson a run for its money. In the end, though, I believe Clemson will come out on top.

The Tigers have been playing well as a team and have demonstrated their strength both offensively and defensively. With players like quarterback Trevor Lawrence and defensive lineman Christian Wilkins, they are sure to dominate the game.

I’m not saying that Alabama won’t put up a good fight; they certainly will. But in the end, I believe Clemson will be victorious.

#  What are the odds for the Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game?

The Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game is a great game to relieve some stress. The object of the game is to clear all of the cards from the table. The game consists of a deck of 52 cards, which are distributed among four suits: hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds. There are 13 cards in each suit. The remaining card is placed in the middle of the table, and is called the "foundation."

The player can move any card from one of the four suits on to another suit, if it is possible to do so. An Ace can be moved to either 2 or King, a 2 can be moved to Ace or 3, a 3 can be moved to 2 or 4, and so on. When all possible moves have been made within a suit, that suit's cards are placed on the foundation. The foundation starts with the Ace and builds up by suit until it reaches King.

When no more moves are possible within a particular suit, then that suit's cards can be removed from the table and set aside. This leaves any empty spaces as open spots for new cards to be dealt into. When all of the cards have been dealt, then the player has lost the game.

The Clemson Sport Retro Solitaire Game is based on an older version of solitaire that was popular back in the 1970s and 1980s. This game can be played using either real cards or virtual cards on your computer or mobile device.
