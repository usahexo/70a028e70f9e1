#  Trump Casino Developer in Atlantic City Fined $10M

President Donald Trump's casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey was fined $10 million by the state gaming commission in 2015. 

The penalty was levied against Trump Entertainment Resorts for failing to withhold taxes from employee wages. The company also failed to report more than $1.5 million in winnings by four of its gamblers.

According to the New Jersey Gaming Commission, the $10 million fine was the largest ever assessed against a casino in the state.

#  Trump's Fate in Atlantic City Casino Development

Atlantic City, like other gaming centers, had its heyday in the early 1900s. Gambling was legalized in New Jersey in 1976, and by 1984, Atlantic City had 11 gambling halls. The casinos brought in $5 billion in revenue annually at their peak.

But development of casino gambling did not create the jobs or wealth that were promised to the residents of Atlantic City and the workers in the casino industry. In fact, as casino development occurred, poverty increased in Atlantic City. 

Donald Trump was one of the developers who saw opportunity in Atlantic City. He became involved through his ownership of two casinos in Atlantic City, Trump Plaza and Trump Taj Mahal. But his investment didn't turn out well. The casinos struggled from the beginning and filed for bankruptcy twice.

In 2009, Trump Entertainment Resorts, which owned both casinos, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That filing listed more than $1.8 billion in debts. It also revealed that Trump had allowed his name to be used on two struggling casinos even though he had no ownership stake in them. 

A month after the bankruptcy filing, bondholders agreed to a deal that would give them a majority stake in Trump Entertainment Resorts. That left Donald Trump with just a 10 percent ownership stake. In February 2014, Trump resigned from his position as CEO of the company citing disappointment with his treatment by bondholders . 

It's been reported that Donald Trump has lost over $300 million on his investment in Atlantic City casino development. Clearly, this has not been a successful venture for him .

#  Trump's Future in Atlantic City Casino Development in Doubt

Atlantic City, NJ - The future of the Trump's involvement in Atlantic City casino development is in doubt.

The Trump Organization has been involved in multiple projects in the city, including two casinos, but recent reports indicate that the organization may be looking to divest its ownership stakes.

The two casinos, the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza Casino, have both been struggling in recent years. The Taj Mahal was recently taken over by Carl Icahn, while the Plaza is currently closed.

It is not clear what the Trump Organization's plans are for its ownership stakes in these properties, but it is possible that they will be sold off.

This would represent a major shift for the Trump Organization, which has been heavily invested in Atlantic City for many years.

#  Judge Orders Trump to Stop Work on Atlantic City Casino

President Donald Trump has been ordered by a federal judge to stop work on his $1.8 billion casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. U.S. District Judge Jerome Simandle said that the Trump Organization’s partnership with local casino operator, Carl Icahn, posed a potential conflict of interest for the president.

The order comes as a result of a lawsuit filed in February by an investor group, which argued that the partnership between Trump and Icahn constituted a violation of the little-known Constitution’s emoluments clause. That clause prohibits public officials from receiving payments or gifts from foreign governments or international organizations.

The Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the Icahn partnership had been approved by government ethics officials. However, Judge Simandle was not convinced. “The president-elect is Conor McGregor,” he wrote in his ruling. “He throws punches and if he connects those punches – even if they are only partially connected – someone is going down.”

Trump already faces several other lawsuits alleging violations of the emoluments clause.

#  Judge Delays Ruling on Trump's Atlantic City Casino

A federal judge in New Jersey has postponed his ruling on whether to allow President Donald Trump to keep control of three Atlantic City casinos.

In February, the state's Casino Control Commission charged that Trump had failed to maintain required levels of capital in the casinos. In March, the state gambling regulator moved to strip Trump of his casino licenses.

The president's lawyers argued that he had not violated any agreements with the state and that the commission's actions were politically motivated. 

U.S. District Judge Fernando Burullo said Thursday he needed more time to review motions from both sides in the case and did not set a new date for his ruling. 

Trump purchased the casinos in 1984 but has since resigned as chairman of the board.
