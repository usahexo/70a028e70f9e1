#  Blackjack 39 - Ruby: The Game that Took Europe by Storm!

Ruby, the game that took Europe by storm. It is said to have originated in France in the 1700s and quickly spread throughout the continent. Although its exact origins are unknown, Ruby is undoubtedly one of the oldest games still played today.

What is Ruby?

Ruby is a card game for two to six players. The aim of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the last trick also scores a point, making a total of 26 points possible. A standard deck of 52 cards is used, with each player being dealt 13 cards in batches of two or three. There are three different ways to win a hand of Ruby:

1) Winning all thirteen tricks - this is known as a 'mouche' and scores 13 points
2) Winning at least six tricks - this is known as taking 'half' and scores six points
3) Winning the last trick - this is known as 'last' and scores one point

The dealer can be either player or banker, with the banker winning any ties. The banker also collects any stakes placed on the table at the end of each hand.

How to Play

The player to the dealers left begins and play passes clockwise around the table. On each turn, players must either play a card from their hand or draw one from the deck. When two matching cards are played, the first player to say 'rubber' (or 'reproduction') claims both cards and sets them aside; they cannot be played again in that hand. The highest card of the suit led wins unless trump is played, in which case the highest trump wins (Jacks are high). If no trump card is played, then the highest card in the suit which was originally led wins (Aces are high). In addition to playing cards, players can claim any number of cards from their hand which match those already set aside on either side (this includes wildcards). For example: if four clubs have been set aside on one side and there are three clubs left in your hand, you can claim all three clubs from your hand; these would then be added to the four clubs already on display and you would not be able to play any other clubs in that particular hand. Once all players have either played or drawn a card, play passes to the next player clockwise who must then either play or draw another card. The winner of the trick leads next and play continues until everyone has played all their cards - at which point scoring takes place (see above for details). The first player to reach 26 points (or more) wins the game!

#  Blackjack 39 - Ruby: The Gambling Game that Stood the Test of Time!

Ruby has been around since the early 1900s and is still considered one of the most popular casino games today. It’s a fast-paced, easy-to-learn game that can be played with any number of players.

The goal of Ruby is to score 21 points without going over, or to come as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Points are scored by taking cards worth face value – for example, an ace is worth 1 point, a 2 is worth 2 points, and so on. The card values are totalled up to create the player’s hand.

There are a few different ways to play Ruby:

* With hole cards - In this version, each player is dealt two cards face down. The dealer also deals themselves two cards, one face up and one face down. Players then take it in turns to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with their current total). The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If the player goes over 21, they lose automatically. If the dealer goes over 21, all players still in the game win equally.

* Without hole cards - This version works in much the same way as the previous version, except that players don’t receive any hole cards. Instead, they must make their decisions based solely on the five community cards that are placed in the middle of the table after the first round of betting has taken place.

* With doubling down - In this version, players can choose to double their bet after they receive their first two cards. They then receive just one more card and must stick with that total afterwards. This can be a risky move but it can also lead to some big wins!

* With splitting - In this version, if a player receives two cards of the same rank (e.g. two kings), they can choose to split them into two separate hands. They then place an extra bet on each hand and play them both independently from each other from that point on.
