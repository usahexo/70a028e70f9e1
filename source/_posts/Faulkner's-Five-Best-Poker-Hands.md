#  Faulkner's Five Best Poker Hands

William Faulkner is one of the most famous American writers of all time. He was a master of the English language and his writing style is still studied in universities around the world. Faulkner was also a big fan of poker and he played the game for many years. In this article, we're going to take a look at five of Faulkner's best poker hands.

# The Royal Flush

The royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and it's a hand that Faulkner managed to achieve on more than one occasion. The royal flush is made up of five cards of the same suit, with the ace being high. This hand is so rare that it only happens once in every 650,000 hands, so it's no surprise that Faulkner was quite proud of it when he managed to hit it.

# The Straight Flush

The straight flush is another very rare hand in poker and it's made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. Faulkner hit this hand on several occasions and he was always thrilled to do so. In fact, he once said that "the straight flush is the prettiest thing in poker."

# Four Aces

Four aces is another very impressive hand in poker and it's one that Faulkner hit on more than one occasion. This hand is made up of four ace cards and it's extremely rare, occurring only once in every 11,500 hands. When Faulkner hit this hand, he knew that he was going to be very tough to beat.

# Full House

A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three kings and two queens. This is a very common hand in poker and it's one that Faulkner hit on several occasions. In fact, he once said that "a full house never scares me."

#  What Are The Best Poker Hands Faulkner?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as different players have different opinions on what the best poker hands Faulkner are. However, there are a few hands that are generally considered to be strong, and those are the ones that we will discuss in this article.

The first hand that we will look at is called a royal flush. This is the strongest hand possible in poker, and consists of five cards all of the same suit, with the ace being the highest ranking card. If you are able to make a royal flush, you can expect to win a lot of money!

Another strong hand is called a straight flush. This hand consists of five cards all of the same suit, but not all of the same rank. For example, 5-6-7-8-9 of clubs would be a straight flush. This hand is also very powerful, and can often lead to big wins.

Next on our list are fours of a kind. This hand consists of four cards of the same rank, and is generally considered to be very strong. In fact, it is often enough to win outright when playing against other players.

Finally, we have three of a kind. This hand is made up of three cards of the same rank, and is usually not quite as powerful as some of the other hands on our list. However, it can still be quite deadly when played against opponents who do not have a very strong hand themselves.

#  Faulkner's Five Favorite Poker Hands

In any given poker game, there are only a certain number of hands that William Faulkner would be interested in playing. Here are his five favorites:

1. The Aces- This is Faulkner's favorite hand, and he will always play it if he is dealt it. The aces are a powerful hand that can win almost any pot if played correctly.

2. The Kings- Another powerful hand, the kings can be used to bluff or to make strong bets. Faulkner often finds himself using this hand to take down pots at the table.

3. The Queens- Not as powerful as the aces or the kings, the queens are still a formidable hand that can often win smaller pots. Faulkner enjoys playing this hand when he is looking to accumulate chips without taking too much risk.

4. The Jacks- A weaker hand but still a playable one, the jackson can occasionally lead to a big pay day if played correctly. Faulkner usually pairs this hand up with another strong one in order to increase its chances of winning.

5. The 10's or below- These hands are generally not worth playing, but Faulkner will sometimes do so in order to try and trap his opponents into making bad moves. He prefers to fold these hands most of the time, however, in order to conserve his chips for stronger hands later in the game.

#  Faulkner's Best Poker Hand: Royal Flush

There are many great poker hands, but none quite as impressive as a royal flush. A royal flush is the highest possible hand in poker, and it is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. This means that you can have ace through king of the same suit to create a royal flush.

A royal flush is an amazing hand to get, and it can net you a lot of money if you are playing for high stakes. In fact, a royal flush is usually worth about 800 times the amount of the bet that was placed when the hand was dealt. So if you are playing in a game where the minimum bet is $5, and you are dealt a royal flush, you can expect to win $4000.

Of course, not everyone manages to get a royal flush. The odds of hitting one are about 1 in 649,739, which means that they are not exactly common. But if you do hit one, it will definitely make your day – or night!

If you are looking to win big with a royal flush, then you should consider playing in some high stakes games. You can find these games at casinos or online poker rooms. Just be sure to know what you are doing before you sit down at the table – there is a lot of money on the line!

#  Faulkner's Favorite Poker Hands

William Faulkner was an American novelist and poet, who is considered one of the most influential writers in the history of American literature. He is best known for his novels Sanctuary, The Sound and the Fury, Absalom, Absalom!, and As I Lay Dying.

Faulkner was also a dedicated poker player, playing frequently at the Hollywood Athletic Club in Los Angeles. In fact, he once said that he would rather play poker than write.

While Faulkner was certainly no stranger to winning hands, there were a few that he enjoyed playing more than others. His favorite poker hands were all pocket pairs: 22, 44, 66, and 88.

Interestingly, Faulkner never won a pot with pocket kings or queens. In fact, his highest-ever winnings came from a hand in which he held two eights.

Despite being one of the most successful poker players of his time, Faulkner preferred to keep his love of the game private. In a letter to his publisher Robert Haas in 1948, Faulkner wrote: "I don't want any publicity about my poker playing because it might injure my reputation as a serious writer."
