#  What are the most important factors driving growth in this market?

The increase in the number of working women has led to the shift in the preference of consumers towards convenient food products such as canned seafood. Additionally, the rise in consumer spending on food has propelled the demand for canned seafood. Moreover, growing awareness about the health benefits associated with canned seafood is also propelling its demand.

Some of the key players operating in the global canned seafood market are Thai Union Group PCL, Dongwon Industries Co., Ltd., Pescanova S.A., Pride Seafoods Ltd., The Nisshin Oceans Corporation Ltd., Regal Springs Holding BV, Maruha Nichiro Corporation, Marine Harvest ASA, and Lerøy Seafood Group AS.

#  How will digital transformation impact the demand for software and IT business consulting services?

## Introduction

The demand for software and IT business consulting services is forecast to grow as organizations undergo digital transformation. This means that businesses will need to change the way they operate in order to stay competitive in a digital world. The role of the consultant is changing as well, and they are becoming more involved in helping clients with business strategy and transformation initiatives.

## Impact of Digital Transformation on the Consulting Industry

A recent study by Gartner found that through 2021, spending on digital transformation consulting services will grow at a rate of 11.4% per year. That’s more than twice the rate of overall IT spending growth. This is because businesses are realizing that they need help making the shift to a digital culture. Consultants are in a good position to help with this, due to their understanding of technology and ability to provide guidance on how it can be used to improve operations.

In addition to spending on traditional consulting services, businesses are also investing in new types of services that focus on digital transformation. These include big data, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing. As the demand for these services continues to grow, so will the demand for consultants who specialize in them.

## Role of the Consultant in Digital Transformation

The role of the consultant is changing as companies move towards digital transformation. They are no longer just providers of technology advice, but are now being relied on more for their business strategy skills. In many cases, they are becoming part of the executive team and playing a key role in driving innovation within the organization.

This shift requires consultants to have a broader range of skills and knowledge. They must be able to understand how new technologies can be applied to solve business problems, as well as understand the challenges and opportunities that come with digital transformation. They must also be able to articulate the value proposition of new technologies and help clients develop a plan for implementing them successfully.

#  What are the biggest challenges that service providers face in this market?

There are a number of challenges that service providers face in this market, but the biggest ones are probably around delivering an acceptable quality of service (QoS) and keeping costs down.

Delivering an acceptable QoS can be difficult because the technology involved is always changing and evolving, so it's difficult to keep up with the latest trends. In addition, there are always new players entering the market, so service providers have to constantly compete to stay ahead.

Another challenge for service providers is keeping costs down. This is important because customers are increasingly unwilling to pay high prices for telecom services, and so providers need to find ways to be more efficient and reduce their costs. This can be difficult because telecom networks are becoming increasingly complex, and there are a lot of different components that need to be managed properly in order to deliver good service quality.

#  What new technology trends will have the biggest impact on the software and IT business consulting services market?

The software and IT business consulting services market is constantly changing and evolving, as new technologies come onto the scene and older technologies are phased out. In order to stay ahead of the curve and provide the best possible service to their clients, it's important for business consultants to keep up with the latest trends.

So, what are the top technology trends that will have the biggest impact on the software and IT business consulting services market in 2018? Here are six of them:

1. Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest tech trends right now, and it's no surprise that it's also making its way into the business world. AI can be used to automate tasks such as customer service and data entry, which can help businesses save time and money. Additionally, AI can be used to improve decision-making processes, allowing businesses to make better strategic decisions based on data analytics.

Businesses that want to stay competitive in the software and IT consulting services market should start incorporating AI into their offerings. As more and more businesses begin to use AI, those that don't will quickly fall behind.

2. Augmented reality

Augmented reality (AR) is another hot technology trend that is gaining traction in the business world. AR allows users to overlay digital information onto the real world, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as training employees or marketing products.

Similar to AI, businesses that want to stay ahead of the curve in the software and IT consulting services market should start incorporating AR into their offerings. As more businesses begin using AR, those that don't will quickly lose ground.

3. Blockchain technology

Blockchain technology is still relatively new, but it has already gained a lot of traction in a number of industries. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure transactions between multiple parties without requiring a central authority. This makes it an ideal solution for industries such as finance and healthcare that need to share data securely between multiple parties.

Businesses in the software and IT consulting services market should start investigating how blockchain technology can be used in their industry. As blockchain becomes more popular, those that don't adopt it will fall behind.

4. The Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) is another hot technology trend that is rapidly gaining popularity. The IoT refers to devices (such as smart TVs, wearable devices, and home appliances) that are connected to the internet and can interact with each other autonomously. This allows for a whole new level of automation and connectivity between devices that was not possible before.


Businesses in the software and IT consulting services market should start investigating how they can take advantage of IoT technology. As more devices become connected to the internet, those that don't adopt IoT will be at a disadvantage.
