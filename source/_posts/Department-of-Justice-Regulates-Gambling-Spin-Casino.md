#  Department of Justice Regulates Gambling Spin Casino

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has updated the regulations for gambling, which will affect Spin Casino and other online casinos. The new provisions were published in the Federal Register on October 17, and will take effect on November 13.

The DOJ has been regulating gambling since the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006. The new regulations are designed to clarify and improve the UIGEA. The most significant change is that online casinos will now be able to accept payments from players in the US.

This change is good news for Spin Casino and other online casinos, as it will allow them to compete with land-based casinos. However, there are a number of restrictions that apply:

Online casinos must obtain a license from the state in which they are located.

Players must be over 21 years of age.

Gambling debts are not enforceable in court.

Online casinos must comply with state laws governing gambling.

These restrictions make it more difficult for online casinos to operate in the US than in other countries. For example, UK law allows online casinos to operate without a licence as long as they adhere to certain principles, such as checking customer age and protecting player funds. This is not yet permitted in the US, meaning that online casinos have to set up operations within specific states.

#  Federal Trade Commission Oversees Gambling Spin Casino

As an online gambler, you should be fully aware of the agencies that regulate gambling in your jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, the primary regulator is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which oversees both brick-and-mortar and online casinos.

The FTC has a number of responsibilities with regards to gambling, including:

– ensuring that casinos comply with consumer protection laws (e.g., Truth in Advertising),

– investigating allegations of impropriety by casinos (e.g., cheating, money laundering), and

– providing information to consumers about their rights when gambling online.

If you have a complaint about an online casino – or any other type of gambling business – the FTC wants to hear from you. You can file a complaint on the FTC’s website, or by calling 1-877-382-4357.

#  Nevada Gaming Control Board Monitors Gambling Spin Casino

State gaming regulators in Nevada are keeping a close eye on Spin Casino, one of the latest online gambling destinations to pop up in the Silver State. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) has been monitoring the activity at Spin Casino since early December, and so far has not found any issues with the site.

Spin Casino launched in November 2017 and is licensed out of Malta. The site offers a wide range of slots and table games from some of the biggest providers in the industry, including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play’n GO.

Nevada gaming regulators have been busy over the past year scrutinizing a number of new online gambling sites that have launched since the state legalized internet poker and casino games in 2013. In addition to Spin Casino, regulators have also put their stamp of approval on sites like BoVegas, Ignition Casino, and partypoker.

One reason for the increased scrutiny is that some of these new sites are accepting players from Nevada, even though they are not licensed to do so. This is a direct violation of Nevada law, which requires all online gambling operators to be licensed in the state.

Fortunately for Spin Casino, it appears that they are not currently accepting any players from Nevada. This could change in the future if they decide to target the US market, but for now it looks like they are doing things by the book.

Despite its lack of exposure to the Nevada market thus far, Spin Casino appears to be off to a good start. The site has already amassed a following among players around the world thanks to its large game selection and attractive bonuses.

#  Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation Licenses Gambling Spin Casino

In March of 2018, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation granted a license to the Spin Casino, LLC. The casino is owned by Christopher H. Leone, who also owns the Twin River Casino in Lincoln.

The casino will be located in Newport, next to the Newport Grand Casino, which closed in August of 2017. The Newport Grand was the only casino in Rhode Island other than the Twin River Casino.

The new casino will have 500 slot machines and 25 table games. It is expected to create 150 jobs.

When it opens, the Spin Casino will be the smallest commercial casino in the United States.
