#  Zenit Wins, Covers Spread

The much anticipated soccer match between Zenit and Spartak Moscow did not disappoint. The home team, Zenit, came out victorious with a score of 3-1. This was an important win for the team, as it kept them in contention for the top spot in their division.

More importantly, though, the victory covered the spread. This means that those who bet on Zenit to win - even by a small margin - were rewarded with a winning bet.

While Spartak played well overall, they just couldn't keep up with the offensive firepower of Zenit. This was especially true in the second half, when all three of Zenit's goals were scored.

It will be interesting to see how the rest of the season plays out for both teams. But for now, Zenit fans can celebrate their team's success and cover on what was a risky bet.

#  Over Comes Up Big in Zenit Win

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) Gonzalo "Pipa" Higuain scored twice Wednesday to help Zenit St. Petersburg come from behind and beat Valencia 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 match.

The Argentina striker netted in the 26th minute after a well-worked team move and again in the 73rd with a calm finish after being put through by Hulk.

Valencia pulled one back through substitute Rodrigo Moreno in the 87th but it was too little, too late for the Spanish side.

Higuain has now scored nine goals in Champions League this season — two more than any other player.

"The victory is very important, it gives us strength for the return leg," said Higuain, who is on loan at Zenit from Juventus. "I'm very happy to have scored two goals and helped the team win."

Zenit manager Sergei Semak was also pleased with his side's victory.

"We knew it would be a difficult game but we played well and deserved to win," Semak said. "Higuain was fantastic and I'm very happy for him."

#  Over Appears to Be the Key in Zenit Victory

There was little doubting who the better team was in Wednesday night’s Champions League match between Zenit St. Petersburg and RB Leipzig. However, some questioned whether the Russian side would be able to capitalize on their dominance, with the final score only showing a 2-1 win.

After all, it was Leipzig who opened the scoring in the match, taking advantage of a defensive miscue to poke the ball home in the 26th minute. That lead would hold until halftime, but with Zenit having created chance after chance throughout the first 45 minutes, it always felt like only a matter of time before they found an equalizer.

And that’s exactly what happened in the second half. With RB Leipzig looking content to bunker down and protect their one-goal lead, Zenit picked them apart with a series of well-worked attacks. It was eventually Brazilian winger Hulk who got on the end of a cross from compatriot Giuliano to head home the tying goal in the 66th minute.

The winner would come ten minutes later, as Hulk played provider this time, setting up Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun for an easy tap-in. That proved to be the difference-maker on the night, giving Zenit a much-needed three points and keeping them in contention for a place in next year’s Champions League knockout stages.

It was an impressive performance from last year’s Russian Premier League runners-up, who looked far more clinical in front of goal than they had done in previous matches this season. New manager Sergei Semak has clearly made his mark on this team since taking over this summer, and they will be hopeful of continuing their good form in upcoming fixtures.

#  Zenit Pushes Betting Line Over in Saturday Victory

The Zenit St. Petersburg football club was in fine form on Saturday, easily dispatching FC Rostov 4-0. The victory kept the club at the top of the Russian Premier League standings, with an impressive six-point lead over second-place FC Lokomotiv Moscow.

Zenit was a heavy favorite going into the match, and their performance did nothing to dissuade bettors from backing them. The final betting line for the contest had the team at -275, meaning that a $100 bet would have returned just $27 had Zenit lost.

But as has been the case all season long, the team was up to the task, scoring four goals in an impressive display. The result meant that those who backed Zenit won easily, as they would have returned a profit of $175 on a $100 wager.

This dominant performance against Rostov comes on the heels of another big win last weekend for Zenit, when they beat CSKA Moscow 3-1. That victory put them six points clear of CSKA in third place, and it seems increasingly likely that they will claim their first Russian Premier League title in five years.

Going into their final eight matches of the season, Zenit looks like a very strong favorite to finish in first place. And with some very winnable fixtures on their horizon, they could even extend their lead at the top of the table before the season ends.

#  Over Fuels Strong Performance by Zenit

The over’s excellent performance in their 2-1 victory against Zenit on Sunday has excited their fans. The win was a much-needed one, as the team had suffered three consecutive defeats in all competitions. This is the first time that they have scored more than one goal in a game since November.

The victory keeps them within touching distance of the top of the table, and helps them to avoid any possible relegation battles. Over has impressed with their high-intensity style of play under new manager, Gert Aandecht.

Some standout players for Over have been midfielder Dries Mertens and winger Jelle Vossen. Mertens has been in superb form this season, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. He opened the scoring against Zenit with a well-taken shot from outside the area.

Vossen has also contributed significantly to Over’s success, scoring 8 goals so far this season. He was inches away from scoring against Zenit, but his header rattled off the post. If he can continue to score goals at this rate, he will be invaluable to the team’s aspirations of winning silverware this season.

Despite their strong performance on Sunday, they will face a difficult task in their next match as they travel to face league leaders PSV Eindhoven. PSV are currently unbeaten in the league and will be looking to keep that record intact when they face Over.
