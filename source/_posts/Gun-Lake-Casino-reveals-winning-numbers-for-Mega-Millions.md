The Gun Lake Casino is expanding their facilities with a new hotel. The hotel will feature 144 rooms and an event center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.

The expansion is expected to create 300 jobs, with a majority of them in the hospitality industry. Construction on the project is set to begin in 2019, with completion slated for late 2020.

“This investment in our community is another example of the positive effects of tribal gaming,” said Craig Mast, chairperson of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians. “It will create hundreds of jobs and attract even more people to the Gun Lake Casino and our region overall. We are grateful to our partners in government who have helped make this possible.”

Rockford Construction Company is no stranger to casino expansions, having completed projects such as the $130 million expansion of the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort in Mt. Pleasant and the $277 million MGM National Harbor Resort and Casino in Maryland.

This newest endeavor by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and Rockford Construction Company is yet another sign that the casino industry continues to grow throughout the United States.
