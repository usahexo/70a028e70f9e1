#  FREE MONEY ON FANDUEL! - Learn how to win without spending a penny

Are you looking to start playing daily fantasy sports but don't want to spend any money? Or maybe you've been playing for a while but have yet to win a contest? Well, you're in luck, because in this article I'm going to teach you how to win contests on Fanduel without spending a penny.

First let's take a look at the basics. Daily fantasy sports (DFS) is a type of contest where players compete against other players by building lineups of real life athletes. The objective is to score the most points based on the athletes' actual performance in their respective games. Fanduel is one of the largest providers of DFS contests, and offers a variety of game types and prize pools.

Now that we know what DFS is, let's take a look at how to win free money on Fanduel without spending any cash. The easiest way to do this is by using the optimizer tool on the Fanduel website. This tool allows you to create custom lineups based on specific criteria, such as salary cap, position eligibility, and game type.

The optimizer tool can be helpful, but it's not always perfect. Sometimes it will recommend players who are overpriced or who are not projected to play many minutes. In these cases, it's important to be able to identify value plays. Value plays are players who are priced lower than their expected production level. Identifying value plays is essential if you want to win contests on Fanduel without spending any money.

There are a number of different ways to find value plays. One way is by studying the Vegas odds for each game. The Vegas odds provide an estimate of how many points each team is expected to score, which can be used to help identify value plays at each position. Another way to find value plays is by using data from fantasy analysts like RotoWorld or ESPN.com. These sources typically release player projections ahead of each slate of games, which can be used to identify undervalued players.

Once you've identified some value plays, it's important to craft a lineup that will maximise their potential output. One way to do this is by filling your lineup with high upside players. High upside players are players who have the potential to score a lot of points even if they are not expected to play many minutes. A great example of a high upside player is Carmelo Anthony, who often scores 20+ points even when he only plays 25-30 minutes off the bench.

If you can put together a lineup that consists of high upside players and value plays, you'll have a good chance of winning free money on Fanduel without spending any cash!
