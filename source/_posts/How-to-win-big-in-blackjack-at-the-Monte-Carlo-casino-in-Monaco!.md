In particular, learn about the following: deck penetration (the percentage of cards that are actually dealt out), dealer hitting on soft 17 (a hand consisting of an Ace and a six), and doubling down (being able to double your bet after seeing your first two cards).
2 - Choose a casino that offers favorable rules. A good rule of thumb is to seek out casinos that offer deck penetration of more than 75%, dealer hitting on soft 17, and doubling down on any two cards.
3 - Bring plenty of cash. Most casinos in Monaco don't accept credit cards, so be sure to bring enough cash with you.
4 - Be aware of your bankroll. Don't bet too much or too little based on the size of your bankroll. Remember that it's better to walk away when you're ahead rather than risk losing it all.
5 - Drink responsibly. Alcohol can impair your judgment and make it difficult to make rational decisions at the table. Stick with water or soda if you want to stay sharp while playing blackjack."
