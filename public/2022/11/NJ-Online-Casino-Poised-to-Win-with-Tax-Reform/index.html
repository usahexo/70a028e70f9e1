<p>According to a recent report in The Press of Atlantic City, the Garden State faces a $1.5 billion dollar shortfall in casino revenue over the next two years if federal lawmakers do not approve a reduction in taxes on winnings at the state’s casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>The article goes on to say that, “without action by Congress, Atlantic City will lose another 800 jobs in 2018 and another 500 jobs in 2019.” This would be in addition to the 8,000 jobs that have already been lost in the last ten years.</p>
<p>Clearly, something needs to be done and it looks like Governor Christie is pinning his hopes on Washington D.C. lawmakers. In a speech earlier this year, he said, “Passage of this bill is critical to the future of Atlantic City and our economy as a whole. We cannot sit idly by while other states benefit from tax policies that put us at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>So why all the fuss over tax reform?</p>
<p>It comes down to dollars and cents. In order for New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks to remain competitive with those in other states, they need a reduction in taxes on winnings. Currently, those taxes stand at 40 percent, while neighboring Pennsylvania has a tax rate of only 18 percent. That’s a big difference and one that is costing New Jersey jobs and revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Christie isn’t alone in his quest for tax reform. Many other governors are pushing for similar changes at the federal level. Unfortunately, partisan politics may get in the way of such reform happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>At least there is bipartisan support for change among New Jersey’s legislators. As State Senator Jim Whelan said recently, “It just makes no sense whatsoever to have these high taxes when our neighbors have lower taxes.” He went on to say that he is optimistic about reform happening this year but added “no one knows for sure what will happen in Washington D.C.”</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is wait and see what happens with tax reform at the federal level. In the meantime, Governor Christie has vowed to do everything he can to keep New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks afloat – including pushing for changes at the state level should federal reform fall through.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Online-Casino-to-Benefit-Most-from-Tax-Reform"><a href="#NJ-Online-Casino-to-Benefit-Most-from-Tax-Reform" class="headerlink" title="NJ Online Casino to Benefit Most from Tax Reform"></a>NJ Online Casino to Benefit Most from Tax Reform</h1><p>Tuesday, December 19, 2017</p>
<p>The recently-passed tax reform legislation in the United States is expected to help the online gambling industry, including New Jersey’s regulated online casinos. The new bill includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is good news for those companies with a heavy presence in the US market.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s regulated online casinos are currently taxed at a rate of 15%, so they are expected to benefit significantly from the reduced corporate tax rate. In addition, the new bill allows for full expensing of capital investment, which will also benefit the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>Industry insiders believe that these tax reforms will help fuel growth in the online gambling sector, especially in states like New Jersey that have already legalized and regulated the industry. This could be great news for fans of NJ online casino games, as it could lead to even more competition and innovation in the market.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly how much of an impact the new tax bill will have on the online gambling industry, but it is clear that companies like Caesars Entertainment (which owns NJ’s regulated online casinos) stand to benefit greatly from the changes. It will be interesting to see how this affects the competitive landscape in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Could-Benefit-from-GOP-Tax-Plan"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Could-Benefit-from-GOP-Tax-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Could Benefit from GOP Tax Plan"></a>Online Gambling Could Benefit from GOP Tax Plan</h1><p>The Republican tax overhaul has plans to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, which would be a good thing for the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>According to a report from Reuters, this move would shrink the competitive gap between brick-and-mortar casinos and their online counterparts.</p>
<p>“This is significant news for the industry, as it closes what has been a competitive disadvantage for online companies in terms of taxation levels,” analyst David Bain of global affairs research firm Oxford Economics told Reuters.</p>
<p>The lower corporate tax rate would also go a long way in helping the US gambling industry repatriate money that is currently being held overseas. Gambling companies are holding an estimated $16 billion in offshore profits, and they stand to gain an estimated $2.5 billion if the new tax plan is enacted.</p>
<p>While there is still some uncertainty about how the new tax plan will play out, it is clear that the potential benefits for the online gambling industry are significant. This could be great news for players who are looking for better experiences and more options when it comes to gambling online.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Casinos-Poised-to-Benefit-from-Tax-Reform"><a href="#New-Jersey-Casinos-Poised-to-Benefit-from-Tax-Reform" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Casinos Poised to Benefit from Tax Reform"></a>New Jersey Casinos Poised to Benefit from Tax Reform</h1><p>On the heels of federal tax reform, the New Jersey casino industry is expecting a windfall.</p>
<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, significantly lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This is good news for the casino industry, which is highly taxed.</p>
<p>According to a report by Reuters, the lower tax rate is expected to save the casino industry $1.5 billion annually. This will help companies like MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corporation improve their profitability and invest more in their businesses.</p>
<p>The tax reform bill is also expected to boost employment in the casino industry. Reuters quoted an analyst who said that the bill could create up to 20,000 jobs in the casino sector.</p>
<p>“The new investment will be in areas such as technology and innovation, including expansion of resort amenities and attractions,” said Bill Bullock, president of global development for Caesars Entertainment Corporation.</p>
<p>In addition to the lower corporate tax rate, the new tax bill also allows businesses to immediately write off the cost of new equipment. This will help casinos upgrade their facilities and offer new gaming options to customers.</p>
<p>All of these factors are good news for casino operators in New Jersey. The state’s gaming market has been sluggish in recent years due to increased competition from neighboring states. But with federal tax reform providing a boost to the industry, casinos in New Jersey are now well positioned to grow their revenues and create jobs.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Win-with-Tax-Reform"><a href="#NJ-Casinos-Poised-to-Win-with-Tax-Reform" class="headerlink" title="NJ Casinos Poised to Win with Tax Reform"></a>NJ Casinos Poised to Win with Tax Reform</h1><p>When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act just before the end of 2017, it was unclear how the new law would impact the casino industry. But as more is learned about how the law will work, it is looking like New Jersey’s casinos could be big winners.</p>
<p>The TCJA includes a provision that allows businesses to fully deduct their gambling losses. This could be a major boon to casinos, as it will allow them to write off any losses they incur during the year. This could provide a significant tax savings for casinos, and could help them stay competitive with other gaming destinations such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>In addition to the deduction for gambling losses, the TCJA also includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate. This will also benefit casinos, as it will reduce their overall tax burden.</p>
<p>All of these changes are expected to help New Jersey’s casinos compete better against their counterparts in other states. In fact, some experts are predicting that this could lead to an increase in casino revenue in New Jersey over the next few years.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no indication that any other states are planning to follow New Jersey’s lead and offer similar tax breaks to their casinos. This could give New Jersey’s casinos a significant competitive advantage over other gaming destinations.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how effective these changes will be in boosting casino revenue in New Jersey. But with taxes set to decline for businesses across the board, it is clear that the casino industry stands to benefit from the new law.</p>
